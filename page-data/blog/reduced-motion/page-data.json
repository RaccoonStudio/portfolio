Even if this new interface was a success, this release was followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/27/ios-7-motion-sickness-nausea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">important media coverage of people reporting motion sickness and vertigo</a> while using their device.</p>\n<p>For one of the first time, digital designers were confronted to the fact that yes, <strong>user interfaces can make people sick</strong>.</p>\n<p>Of course, it was not the first interface creating motion sickness. But iOS have a big number of users and Apple has made an effort to make their products accessible which put the spotlight on something often forgotten by web builders: <a href=\"https://a11yproject.com/posts/understanding-vestibular-disorders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vestibular disorders</a> and other cognitive impairments.</p>\n<p>Roughly speaking, vestibular disorders affect the users’ balance and their visual perception of the world around them. This is mainly due to a problem with their inner ear.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Who-can-benefit-from-motionless-animations\"><a href=\"#Who-can-benefit-from-motionless-animations\" aria-label=\"Who can benefit from motionless animations permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"#666\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 8px; margin-left: -12px;\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Who can benefit from motionless animations?</h2>\n<p>When browsing a website or using a web application, <strong>animations can have a significant impact on users’ experience</strong>. The motion sickness resulting from iOS’s new animations put the spotlight on the vestibular disorders spectrum but, it is not the only impairment affected by these animations. <strong>Reducing motion effects in animations can help most of the users with cognitive impairments.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, users with reduced attention span (ADHD people, some autistic folks, users recovering after a stroke, etc.) can also benefit from having alternative animations that have less impact on their cognitive load.</p>\n<p>Because <em>motion is wonderful except when it is not</em>, Apple included <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202655\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an option in the accessibility settings to allow users the ability to disable some native iOS animations</a> like parallax and app launching effects. In 2014, they also <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#prefers-reduced-motion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proposed a <em>reduced-motion</em> media query</a> to avoid creating discomfort to users suffering from motion sickness. Since 2017, heavy animations on their website are replaced by more accessible ones when this option is activated.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, some conditions apply: to this date, this media query is <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=prefers-reduced-motion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">only supported by Safari, iOS Safari, Firefox and Chrome 74+</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"A-solution-too-often-misunderstood-in-its-use\"><a href=\"#A-solution-too-often-misunderstood-in-its-use\" aria-label=\"A solution too often misunderstood in its use permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"#666\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 8px; margin-left: -12px;\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A solution too often misunderstood in its use</h2>\n<p>More and more, we can see designers and developers using the reduced-motion media query in their projects.

Even if we are considering a wider range of impairments with attention-related issues, <strong>the idea was never to remove all animations of an interface</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful animations help users to discover, navigate and understand an interface.</strong> Animations are often <strong>needed to offer good user experience</strong> and to avoid users’ cognitive overload with progressive disclosure of processes, content or actions. <strong>Removing all animations unconditionally for users with an active reduced-motion option will impact their experience.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"When-should-we-use-the-reduced-motion-media-feature\"><a href=\"#When-should-we-use-the-reduced-motion-media-feature\" aria-label=\"When should we use the reduced motion media feature permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" fill=\"#666\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 8px; margin-left: -12px;\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>When should we use the reduced-motion media feature?</h2>\n<p>First of all, in the case of vestibular disorders, motion sickness is only triggered by really specific types of animations.</p>\n<p>To summarize, motion sickness is mainly triggered by <strong>scaling/zoom effects</strong>, especially when associated with a <strong>blur (dis)appearance</strong>, <strong>spinning or moving elements</strong> and <strong>parallax effects</strong>.</p>\n<p>To be more in sync with the usage of this accessibility option by users, we can also add <strong>constant animations</strong> without play/pause controls and <strong>animations requiring a large attention span</strong> or highly distracting.</p>\n<p>Let’s face it: this is clearly not the bigger part of the animations we design and build in our interfaces.
